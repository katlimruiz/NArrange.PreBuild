This file is a hook to invoke the PowerShell scripts in the NArrange.PreBuild package.

It is safe to both remove this file from a project and delete it from the project folder.
This file should not be deleted from the package folder.

This file should be both automatically removed from a project and deleted from the project folder when the NArrange.PreBuild package is installed.
If this file either has not been removed from a project automatically or has not been deleted from a project folder automatically, there may be a problem with the NArrange.PreBuild package and this should be reported at <TODO>.
